## One - blog post

[One](https://github.com/minosiants/one) is a template for a [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) based personal website and blog. Very simple way to use it by keeping it in a git repo and setting up [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)  using this repo and publish it online. When a new blog post is created it should be placed into posts folder and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will pull and publish. 

I use it for this website.

#### There are several reasons why I created it.

 - I wanted to update my web page for a while because my old one https://minosiants.github.io/ is really old already. 
 - I'm doing set of the simple apps to cover different parts of modern crafting software. ([zero](https://minosiants.github.io/zero) was the first one to refresh my css and javascript skills).
 - Try [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)  + modern css to get feeling how it goes for web apps.

#### The overall experience is positive. 

 - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) allows to build UI components very easy. I also like how it provides encapsulation of css and javascript for each component. So no need for  BEM notation anymore.  
 - CSS now is very powerful. Allows to build responsive UI even without using media queries.   Flexbox is a king :). CSS variables are really cool as well.
 - I started to using typescript but did not like it so moved back to javascript. I think typescript is really overkill. Modern javascript is nice.  


#### Some references and resources that guide me through this development.
- [Every layout](https://every-layout.dev/) book . It beautifully explains how to build a modern responsive layout without media queries. Its approach so elegant. I used it in my layout css.
- Another wonderfull book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) . It teaches hot to ui make UI components look clean and powerful. To make accent for apps customers what they should do without much think and looking around.
- One more book [Art and Visual Perception](https://www.amazon.com.au/Art-Visual-Perception-Psychology-Creative/dp/0520243838) .  Art is my hobby so I came across this book. [Rudolf Arnheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Arnheim) , the author of the book, explains the psychology how people percept visual objects. Really powerful. I'm sting reading it because it is really slow read book.    
- [Josh Collinsworth svelte template](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter) I'm happy that I came across [Josh github](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth) .
- I used [Hyperlegible] free font which  is very clean and pleasent to read.
- [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/) helped to find a good colore pallet. 
	

	
	
	[One](https://github.com/minosiants/one) is a template for a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) based personal website and blog. It offers a simple way to create and host a site by storing it in a Git repository and deploying it through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). To publish a new blog post, place it in the posts folder, and Netlify will automatically pull and deploy the update.
	
	#### I use this template for my own website.
	
	Why I Created It
	
	- My previous website, [minosiants.github.io](https://minosiants.github.io/), was outdated and needed a refresh.
	
	- I’m working on a series of simple apps to explore various aspects of modern software development. ([Zero](https://minosiants.github.io/zero) was the first, helping me revisit CSS and JavaScript.)
	  
	- I wanted to experiment with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and modern CSS to understand their potential for web applications.
	    
	
	#### My Experience
	
	- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) makes building UI components straightforward and intuitive. I also like how it provides encapsulation of css and javascript for each component. So no need for  BEM notation anymore.
	- Modern CSS is incredibly powerful, enabling responsive UI design without relying heavily on media queries. Flexbox is a standout feature, and CSS variables add flexibility and ease.
	-  I started by typescript but did not like it so moved back to javascript. I think typescript is really overkill. Modern javascript is nice.
	    
	
	#### Resources That Guided Development
	
	- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/): This book elegantly explains how to create modern, responsive layouts without media queries. I applied its principles to my CSS layout.
	    
	- [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/): A fantastic guide for designing clean, effective UI components that guide users intuitively.
	    
	- One more book [Art and Visual Perception](https://www.amazon.com.au/Art-Visual-Perception-Psychology-Creative/dp/0520243838) .  Art is my hobby so I came across this book. [Rudolf Arnheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Arnheim) , the author, explains the psychology how people percept visual objects. Really powerful. It’s a dense, slow read I’m still working through. 
	    
	- [Josh Collinsworth’s SvelteKit Blog Starter](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter): Discovering [Josh’s GitHub](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth) was a great find, and his template inspired parts of this project.
	    
	- [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont): A clean, highly readable free font used in the project.
	    
	- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/): A helpful tool for selecting an effective color palette.
