# A welcome from John A. De Goes

  
Dear Patron,  
  
I want to thank you deeply for becoming a patron at the Spartan tier.  
  
Please feel free to add me to WhatsApp using my personal cell phone number: +1-303-921-5784. Reach out to me anytime with quick questions or just to say hi!  
  
Your tier includes access to the following exclusive benefits:  
  

-   **Private posts**. Published regularly over the course of a year, these posts includes educational content for aspiring functional programmers, as well as tips on personal and professional development, hot takes on industry events, and highlights for my travel and speaking schedule.
-   **Private Discord**. Hang out with me and dozens of other Patron supporters, in a private Discord community full of positive energy. We're all on the same page here, working to help ourselves and each other become the best we can be. I dedicate my personal time to helping developers on this Discord.
-   **Remote trainings**. Remotely attend all my public trainings, free of charge. These trainings cover select topics in functional design, the Scala programming language, functional abstraction, functional data modeling, and much more. Normally my trainings retail for up to $2k per event, which makes this a phenomenal value.
-   **Private weekly trainings**. Attend a weekly training session, where I train Spartans on everything I know about functional design, functional programming, open source development, performance optimization, and so much more. This is the fastest way to learn new concepts in an applied setting with a consistent pace.
-   **All-day coding sessions**. Watch me live as I code open source software, talking through every aspect of what I do and why I do it. Learn quickly from my experience how to create real-world software using the techniques of functional programming.
-   **Office hours**. Meet with me once a month in a private 1-on-1, where I can teach you functional programming, Scala, or other topics, or we can work on presentations, talks, articles, open source libraries, or your own personal projects.

  
To kick-off the Spartan program, I would like to meet with you personally, so I can introduce you to the program and learn more about your background and goals. To schedule this meeting, go to the private Discord group, join the #spartans channel, and look at the Pinned messages. You will see my appointment calendar for the Spartan program. **Please book any 30 minute appointment to kick-off your entry into the Spartan program!**  
  
It's entirely thanks to developers like you that I'm able to spend so much of my time blogging about functional programming, speaking at meetups and conferences, and contributing to open source.  
  
Speaking on a personal note, I can also say without reservation that given the adversity I've faced in my professional life, I would never have made it this far without the encouragement of people like you.  
  
If we haven't met already, then I hope to meet you one day and say thank you in person, over coffee, or a beerâ€”my treat!  
  
Yours,  
  
John A. De Goes
