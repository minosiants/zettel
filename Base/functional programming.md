# Functional Programming


-  `referentially transparent` - in any program expression can be replaced by its result `RT`  
-  `higher-order function` - function which takes another function as an argument or can return function `HOF`  
-  `polymorphic function` - function that works for any given type  
-  `parcial function` - function that not totally applied  
-  `currying` - converts function with two arguments into a function with one argument partially applied    
-  `covariant` - LIst[+A] - + means positive (other) parameter of List (List[Dog]considered of a subtype of List[Animal])  
-  `ADT` - algebraic data type .- data type defined one or more data constructors , each of which can contain one or more arguments. Data type is `sum` or `union` of its data constructors and each constructor is product of its arguments hence the name is `algebraic` data type   

- `foldRight` - goes from right to left
- `evalute to bottom`   A function f is strict if the expression f(x) evaluates to bottom for all x that  
- `functor` captures the notion of something you can map over, changing its “contents” (or output) but not the structure itself.   

evaluate to bottom.
