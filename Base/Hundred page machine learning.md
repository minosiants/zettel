## 1 Introduction
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Semi supervised learning
- Reinforcment learning

## 2 Notation and definitions 
#### Data structures
- scalar - simple numerical value
- vector - orderd list of scalar values
- matix - rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns
- set - unorderd collection of unique elements. [a, b] - includes a and b (a, b) - does not include a and b

multiplicatoin matrix by vector - ??
 - derivative 
 - process of finding derivative is called differentiation.
 - probability mass function (pmf)
 - continuous random variable   (CRV)
 - probability density function (PDF)  
 - unbiased estimators
 - Bayes' Rule
 - Hyperparameter - property of a learning algorithm haveing a numerical value
 - Classification - problem of automatically assigning lable to unlabled example. Spam detection is a famouse example of classification
 - Regression - problem of predicting a real-valued lable (target)

## Fundamental algorithms
- Linear regression
- Logic regression
- Decision tree learning
