# Rust Lifetime

#### [common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md)
In a nutshell: A variable's lifetime is how long the data it points to can be statically verified by the compiler to be valid at its current memory address.

- `T`Â is a superset of bothÂ `&T`Â andÂ `&mut T`
- `&T`Â andÂ `&mut T`Â are disjoint sets
- `T: 'static`Â should be read asÂ _"`T`Â can live at least as long as aÂ `'static`Â lifetime"_
- ifÂ `T: 'static`Â thenÂ `T`Â can be a borrowed type with aÂ `'static`Â lifetimeÂ _or_Â an owned type
- sinceÂ `T: 'static`Â includes owned types that meansÂ `T`
    - can be dynamically allocated at run-time
    - does not have to be valid for the entire program
    - can be safely and freely mutated
    - can be dynamically dropped at run-time
    - can have lifetimes of different durations
- `T: 'a`Â is more general and more flexible thanÂ `&'a T`
- `T: 'a`Â accepts owned types, owned types which contain references, and references
- `&'a T`Â only accepts references
- ifÂ `T: 'static`Â thenÂ `T: 'a`Â sinceÂ `'static`Â >=Â `'a`Â for allÂ `'a`
- almost all Rust code is generic code and there's elided lifetime annotations everywhere
- Rust's lifetime elision rules are not always right for every situation
- Rust does not know more about the semantics of your program than you do
- give your lifetime annotations descriptive names
- try to be mindful of where you place explicit lifetime annotations and why
- all trait objects have some inferred default lifetime bounds
- Rust compiler error messages suggest fixes which will make your program compile which is not that same as fixes which will make you program compileÂ _and_Â best suit the requirements of your program
- lifetimes are statically verified at compile-time
- lifetimes cannot grow or shrink or change in any way at run-time
- Rust borrow checker will always choose the shortest possible lifetime for a variable assuming all code paths can be taken
- try not to re-borrow mut refs as shared refs, or you're gonna have a bad time
- re-borrowing a mut ref doesn't end its lifetime, even if the ref is dropped
- every language has gotchas ðŸ¤·
